# WatsonCSharp
C#.NET wrapper for IBMs Watson APIs mirroring established Java Wrappers.

What is Watson?  Much of the info can be found at https://developer.ibm.com/watson/
It's set of smart APIs that can draw conclusions from a range of data including text, sound and images.
There is free access to the API but requires you to go through Bluemix.

Still early in creating these wrappers.  As a general rule, I am trying to translate 
the Java wrappers provided at https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/java-sdk
While converters to provide some help, matching the appropriate libraries is fun.
